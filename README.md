fjorge
======

`fjorge` is a command-line program for manually crafting and recording forged
HTTP(S) requests to be sent to a web server's TCP and TLS ports.  It's intended 
to be like an HTTP `netcat` insofar as it allows as much user control over the 
protocol data as possible.  This tool is written in C11 and was tested on Ubuntu 
16.04.3 LTS.
