fjorge
======

fjorge is a command-line program for manually crafting and recording forged
HTTP(S) requests to be sent to a web server's TCP and TLS ports.  It's intended 
to be similar to netcat insofar as it allows as much user control over the input 
data as possible. This cool is written in C11.
